=============

### Intro
This is my repository for the assignment. 

My additions to the make pipeline consists of 
* [rmd file](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw09-rning-wu/blob/master/letterfreq.rmd)
* [r script](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw09-rning-wu/blob/master/letterfreq.r)
  
For the finished products, you can see here: 
* [md file](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw09-rning-wu/blob/master/letterfreq.md)

For the makefile pipeline: 
* [Makefile](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw09-rning-wu/blob/master/Makefile)

The plot and the data file can be found in the main directory too. 

### Analysis

The task I did was visualizing the letter frequencies in the dictionary of English words.
